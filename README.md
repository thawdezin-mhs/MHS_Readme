## General info


## Warning
1. In every UIScrollView, UICollectionView and UITableView, you must remove scroll indicator. 😮‍💨
2. Never trust API, Seriouly! use ```?? "api nil"``` code to detect every API nil. If something went wrong, check API call first 😁 NEVER USE ```?? ""```. Let tester team know, that error comes from API not from iOS. 👻
3. Change every MMK to Ks in every Product Price 🥲
